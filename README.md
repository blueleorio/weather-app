After countless failed attempts at learning Git, with the help from my Mentor, I eventually succeeded in creating new repo using Gitbash command line.

> 1. "git add . "
> 2. "git commit -m "updateReadme"
> 3. "git push -u origin main" => _I still have no idea what the deal with -u origin or even main_

### Normally, after the first commit and push, I switch to **VSCODE** built-in Source Control.
