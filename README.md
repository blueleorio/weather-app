After countless failed attempts at learning Git, with the help from my Mentor, I eventually succeeded in creating new repo using Gitbash command line.
. "git add . "
. "git commit -m "updateReadme"
. "git push -u origin main" => ###I still have no idea what the deal with -u origin or even main

Normally, after the first commit and push, I switch to VSCode built-in Source Control.
